# Diabetic_Retinopathy_Log_Reg_Risk_Model
Overview of the Project
In this projectt, we'll build a risk score model for retinopathy in diabetes patients using logistic regression.

Diabetic Retinopathy
Retinopathy is an eye condition that causes changes to the blood vessels in the part of the eye called the retina. This often leads to vision changes or blindness. Diabetic patients are known to be at high risk for retinopathy.

Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is an appropriate analysis to use for predicting the probability of a binary outcome. In our case, this would be the probability of having or not having diabetic retinopathy
